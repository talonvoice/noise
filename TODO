  [x] get basic happy path working
  [x] allow user to record multiple noises
  [x] load data
  [x] update UI when done recording, and uploading
  [x] load noise info from data json
  [x] add navigation arrows as a precursor to the wizard
  [x] ask for microphone permission on record instead of on load (see: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/media/recording-video/#ask_permission_to_use_camera_responsibly,https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/media/recording-video/#use_the_permissions_api_to_check_if_you_already_have_access)
  [x] get FLAC sample code working (e.g., https://github.com/mmig/speech-to-flac, https://github.com/mmig/speech-to-flac.js)


TECHNICAL HEALTH:

  IN PROGRESS:

  PLANNED:
  [ ] split out CSS by "component"
  [ ] separate recorder status from clip status, then can use NEED_PERMISSIONS permission appropriately

  [ ] update requirements.txt

  ICEBOX:
  [ ] test scenarios
  [ ] fallback to <input>
  [ ] add debouncing
  [ ] add polyfills and fallbacks
    [ ] getUserMedia() - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#Using_the_new_API_in_older_browsers, https://github.com/webrtc/adapter
  [ ] productionize
    [ ] minify/uglify
    [ ] bust caches!
  [ ] replace libflac3*.strict.js with official fix for strict mode when following issue is resolved (https://github.com/mmig/libflac.js/issues/4)
  [ ] test supported desktop browsers
  [ ] smoke test and fix mobile browsers
