# Mouth sounds

## Some basics

There are 3 main parts to how sound is produced with the mouth:
1. HOW the sound is produced - manner of articulation
2. WHERE the sound is produced - point of articulation
3. VIBRATION of vocal cords - voiced or voiceless
To reduce vocal strain, the following sounds focus on voiceless utterances with no vocal chord vibration. For an example of vocal chord vibrations, try making an 's' versus a 'z' sound - you can feel the vibrations of the 'z' in your neck.

* P uses both lips
* F uses lower lip and upper teeth
* S, T are made using the tongue and alveolar ridge
* TH is made by placing tongue against or between the teeth
* CH, SH is made when the center of the tongue approaches the palate
* K is made when the back of the tongue touches the soft palate, or velar

(Pictures of tongue position for each of these... alveolar/ridges behind front teeth, palate, velar/soft palate, etc: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Palatoalveolar_fricative.png/330px-Palatoalveolar_fricative.png)

**P, T, K** are plosives (brief stopping of the airstream)
**F, S, H** are fricatives (almost blocking airstream)

Many of these sounds will be the same utterances, while using your lips to change their tones.
* Relaxed lips are in their natural state, slightly parted.
* To pull your lips back, raise your cheeks as if you are fake smiling. This should make the pitch higher.
* To push your lips forward, make an 'oo' sound and keep your lips in that position. This should make the pitch lower.

## Various hisses

### Hiss (sss)
- Straight hiss sound
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted. This should feel very natural
- Breathe in, through either your noise or mouth, then push it out through your teeth
- Your tongue should stay relaxed behind the teeth and not be pushed against them, and the air should flow easily

### Muted Hiss (thh)
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted
- Breathe in, through either your noise or mouth, then push it out through your teeth
- Let the tip of your tongue rise a little and block some of the air flow
- This should feel like it takes a little more pressure than the straight hiss sound, and the air will go off to the sides rather than the middle

### Restrained Hiss (fff)
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted
- Bring your top front teeth down to gently rest on the top of your lower lip
- Breathe in, through either your noise or mouth, then push it out through your teeth
- This should feel like a little more pressure than sss, and less than thh

### Hi-Hat (tss)
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted
- Have your teeth closed
- Breathe in, through either your noise or mouth, then push it out through your teeth
- The tip of your tongue should start pushed against the small ridge behind your teeth, then immediately drop it to normal position

### Shush (shh)
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted, this should feel very natural
- Breathe in, through either your noise or mouth, then push it out through your teeth
- The middle of your tongue should be raised closer to your palate and the air should still flow easily

## Voiceless noises

- Drop the 'uh' sound
- Keep your lips relaxed and blow out more air to make the lips vibrate slowly 4-5 times

### Tsk aka Tut (C Click, Dental Click)
- Place the tip of your tongue against the roof of your mouth near your top front teeth
- Start by making a 't' sound, to get your mouth in the right shape
- Instead of forcing air out, suck in lightly on your hard palate, in quick succession

### Trot (X Click, Lateral Click)
- Place your tongue against your teeth to one side
- On the side your have placed your tongue, raise your cheek to lift the top lip and expose the teeth
- Suck in gently

### Clop (Q Click, Alveolar Click)
- Think of a horse walking on cobblestones
- Let your mouth hang slightly open with your lips parted
- Place your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then suck in
- As you suck in, your tongue should start to slide back a little
- Eventually it should slide off the roof of your mouth and the suction will create a click sound

## Other Sounds

### Pop
- Relax your jaw and keep your lips pressed very gently together
- Push a very tiny bit of air into your mouth, then quickly open your jaw, pulling your lips apart
- This should create a gentle pop sound that resonates within your mouth and cheeks
- This works best with a bit of moisture on your lips
- Not everyone can do this!

### Reverse Pop
- Start to say the word 'wet' but don't say it - your lips should be pursed
- At the same time that you gently start to pull air into your mouth, pull your lips out and away to get a quieter, higher pitched reverse pop of air
- You may not hear it at first, but the mic does pic it up!

### Smooch
- Purse your lips tighly together, almost as if you've licked something sour
- Forcibly pull or suck in air through the lips, keeping them pursed
